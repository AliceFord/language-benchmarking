# Speedtests

This is a project to speed test many different languages.

### 5 different sequences should be generated:

- A005132 -> a(0) = 0, for n > 0, a(n) = a(n-1) - n if nonnegative and not in sequence, else a(n) = a(n-1) + n

- A002113 -> Palindromes

- A000040 -> Primes

- a005150 -> Look and Say sequence

- A000045 -> Fibonacci numbers, formally F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
